# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key practice in DevOps that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. IaC enables automation and simplifies the management of infrastructure, making it a cornerstone of modern DevOps practices. 

**In simple words â€“ this practice allows us to build and explain our infrastructure using code.**

## Key Concepts of IaC:

1. **Automation:**
    - Infrastructure is automatically provisioned and managed using scripts and definition files, reducing the need for manual configuration.
    
2. **Consistency:**
    - By using code to define infrastructure, environments can be consistently reproduced, ensuring that development, testing, and production environments are identical.

3. **Version Control:**
    - Infrastructure code can be versioned just like application code. This enables tracking of changes, rollback to previous versions, and collaboration among team members.

4. **Scalability:**
    - Infrastructure can be scaled up or down easily by modifying the code and reapplying it, making it adaptable to changing demands.

5. **Documentation:**
    - IaC files serve as documentation of the infrastructure, providing a clear and up-to-date view of the infrastructure setup.

## Examples of IaC Tools:

### 1. Terraform:
Developed by HashiCorp, Terraform is an open-source tool that allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

- **Pros:**
    - Cloud-agnostic, supports multiple providers
    - Strong community support and extensive documentation
- **Cons:**
    - State management can be complex
    - Learning curve for HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)

**Example:**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

## 2. AWS CloudFormation:
A service by Amazon Web Services that provides a common language for describing and provisioning all the infrastructure resources in a cloud environment.

Example:
```
{
  "Resources": {
    "MyEC2Instance": {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
      "Properties": {
        "ImageId": "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0",
        "InstanceType": "t2.micro"
      }
    }
  }
}


- **Pros:**
    Integrated with AWS services
    Supports a wide range of AWS resources
- **Cons:** 
  Limited to AWS
  JSON/YAML syntax can be verbose and complex
3. AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit):
A framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation.

Example: 

``` 
from aws_cdk import (
    aws_s3 as s3,
    core
)

class S3SearchScriptStack(core.Stack):

    def __init__(self, scope: core.Construct, id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)

        # Create an S3 bucket
        self.bucket = s3.Bucket(self, 
            "SearchBucket",
            versioned=True,
            removal_policy=core.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY  # Not for production
        )

```
- **Pros:**

  Allows using familiar programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Java, etc.)
  High-level constructs simplify resource definitions
- **Cons:** 
  Requires knowledge of programming
  Can be more complex for simple tasks compared to declarative options
